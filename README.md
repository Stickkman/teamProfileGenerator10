## Installation
Use 'npm install' from your preferred CLI to install dependencies. 
## Usage
Please make sure you have node.js installed and run 'npm i' from the command line to install needed dependencies.
To start the application type 'node index.js', then simply follow the prompts to enter the necessary information.
You can choose to add more employees by role or build your team at any time after at least one employee is entered.
The prompts contain checks for user input error to prevent mishaps. Once you build your team, 'team.html' will be 
created in the local 'dist' folder which already contains css for styling.  Upon opening the html file you will 
notice that links will be available for certain information such as email and github user accounts.  Simply
click on the link and the pages will automatically open in a new browser.  This goes for emails as well, your
default email program will load up and your ready to communicate. Tests are also available for the application
using jest, more on this in the tests section.
